Project Overview
Plasmasage is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application includes forms to schedule blood donations, request blood donations, and check for eligibility to donate blood. The project aims to streamline the process of blood donation and make it easier for donors and recipients to connect.

Features
- Schedule Blood Donation: Users can fill out a form to schedule a blood donation appointment.
- Request Blood Donation: Users in need of blood can submit a request form.
- Eligibility Check: A form to help users determine if they are eligible to donate blood based on specific criteria.
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users to manage their donations and requests.

Future Enhancements
In future iterations, Plasmasage plans to include:
- Machine Learning Report Analysis: Implementing a system to analyze donor and recipient data for better insights.
- Matching Algorithm: Developing an algorithm to automatically match donors and recipients based on their information, facilitating quicker and more efficient connections.
